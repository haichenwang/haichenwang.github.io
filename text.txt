I am now focused on developing a data analysis to observe the
production of the Higgs boson in association with top quarks.
This is one of the major Higgs boson production modes that are not yet observed.
Its observation will be one important milestone in the study of the Higgs boson,
 as it would be a direct evidence of the top Higgs Yukawa coupling
 and may provide insight to potential beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics.
